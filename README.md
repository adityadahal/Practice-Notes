### AWS Lamda
- Serverless computing service that automatically runs in response to events.(FaaS)
- Called serverless because it allows developers to run code without managing servers.
- Charged for compute time that code chargers, not for idle servers. run time is actually 15 minutes.
- Auto Scaling (Horizontal Scaling) makes as much as function as requests.
